#  Input: heaps is a list of integers giving the count in each heap
#  Output: function returns a single integer which is the nim-sum

#  Input: heaps is a list of integers giving the count in each heap
#         nim_sum is an integer
#  Output: function returns two integers. The first integer is number
#          of counters that has to be removed. The second integer is
#          the number of the heap from which the counters are removed.
#          If the nim_sum is 0, then return 0, 0
